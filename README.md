## Yet another todo app

For the purposes of trying some nice new libraries in an easy environment, integrated with some I like since a while.

Project structure is aligned with [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react#bulletproof-react-%EF%B8%8F-%EF%B8%8F).

* State managemant with `recoil`
* Design with `tailwindcss` and `headlessui`
* Data fetching with `swr` and `axios`
* Common hooks with `react-use`
* Mocks with `msw`
* Testing with `cypress`

`eslint-plugin-react-perf` is used to ensure identity of reference types are stable when depending on it.

### Todos left

* `recoil` state for filter of uncompleted / completed / all
  * use case for `recoil selector`
* add UI switch for theme
* may integrate `storybook` and setup use cases for components
